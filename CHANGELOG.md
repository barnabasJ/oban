## üêë Oban Instance Module

New facade modules allow you to call `Oban` functions on instances with custom names, e.g. not
`Oban`, without passing a `t:Oban.name/0` as the first argument.

For example, rather than calling `Oban.config/1` you'd call `MyOban.config/0`:

```elixir
MyOban.config()
```

It also makes piping into Oban functions far more convenient: 

```elixir
%{some: :args}
|> MyWorker.new()
|> MyOban.insert()
```

## üß© Partial Matches in Testing Assertions

It's now possible to match a subset of fields on args or meta with `all_enqueued`,
`assert_enqueued`, and `refute_enqueued`. For example, the following assertion will now pass:

```elixir
# Given a job with these args: %{id: 123, mode: "active"}

assert_enqueued args: %{id: 123} #=> true
assert_enqueued args: %{mode: "active"} #=> true
assert_enqueued args: %{id: 321, mode: "active"} #=> false
```

The change applies to `args` and `meta` queries for `all_enqueued/2`, `assert_enqueued/2` and
`refute_enqueued/2` helpers.

## ‚è≤Ô∏è Unique Timestamp Option

Jobs are frequently scheduled for a time far in the future and it's often desirable for to
consider `scheduled` jobs for uniqueness, but unique jobs only checked the `:inserted_at`
timestamp.

Now `unique` has a `timestamp` option that allows checking the `:scheduled_at` timestamp instead:

```elixir
use Oban.Worker, unique: [period: 120, timestamp: :scheduled_at]
```

## v2.16.0 ‚Äî 2023-09-22

### Bug Fixes

- [Reindexer] Correct relname match for reindexer plugin

  We can safely assume all indexes start with `oban_jobs`. The previous pattern was based on an
  outdated index format from older migrations.

- [Testing] Support `repo`, `prefix`, and `log` query options in `use Oban.Testing`

For changes prior to v2.16 see the [v2.15][prv] docs.
